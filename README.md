- **Environment:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- **Node.js Version:** 12.x.x
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **Mandatory Files:** `README.md` file at the root of the project
- **File Extensions:** Your code should use the `.js` extension
- **Linting:** Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint

## Provided Files

- `package.json`
- `.eslintrc.js`
- `babel.config.js`

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies.

   npm install
   ```

## Project Structure

The project is structured to help you understand and organize your code effectively. Here's a brief overview:

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code of your application.
  - **`controllers/`**: Handles business logic.
  - **`middlewares/`**: Includes authentication middleware.
  - **`models/`**: Defines MongoDB models.
  - **`routes/`**: Manages API routes.
  - **`utils/`**: Holds utility functions.
  - **`workers/`**: Background worker implementation.

- **`config/`**: Configuration files for your application.

## Running the Application

1. Start your MongoDB server.
   ```bash
   # Example command, adjust as needed
   mongod --dbpath <path-to-your-db>
   ```

2. Start your Redis server.
   ```bash
   # Example command, adjust as needed
   redis-server
   ```

3. Run the application.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Testing

Ensure your code adheres to the linting rules by running:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Additional Notes

- create `.env` file for sensitive information.
- Don't forget to run `$ npm install` when you have the `package.json` file.
